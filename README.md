# Haskell exercises

This is a collection of excercises I work on to learn Haskell.

The solutions are not guaranteed to be correct or complete at all, I mainly use this repository to have a backup of my sketches and try-outs!

I try to follow the well written Haskell guideline at https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell
